Linux â€” Interview Questions & Answers (DevOps-Focused)
1. What is the difference between a process and a thread?
Answer:
A process is an independent execution unit with its own memory. A thread is a lightweight subprocess that shares memory and resources with other threads of the same process.

2. How do you check CPU, memory, and disk usage in Linux?
Answer:

CPU: top, htop, mpstat

Memory: free -m, vmstat, top

Disk: df -h, du -sh *, iostat

3. How can you find which process is using a specific port?
Answer:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo lsof -i :<port>
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep <port>
4. How do file permissions work in Linux? Explain chmod 755.
Answer:
Permissions are given to user, group, and others:

7: read (4) + write (2) + execute (1)

5: read (4) + execute (1)

So chmod 755 file.sh means:

Owner: rwx

Group: r-x

Others: r-x

5. What is the difference between a hard link and a soft link?
Answer:

Hard link: Direct pointer to file data, indistinguishable from the original.

Soft link (symlink): Points to a path; breaks if the target file is deleted.

Find file: find / -name "filename"

Find string in files: grep -r "string" /path/to/dir
