Kubernetes â€” Interview Questions & Answers
1. What are the main components of the Kubernetes control plane?
Answer:

kube-apiserver: Handles API requests.

etcd: Key-value store for cluster state.

kube-scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes.

kube-controller-manager: Runs controllers to manage state.

cloud-controller-manager: Handles cloud-specific logic.

2. What is the difference between a Pod, ReplicaSet, and Deployment?
Answer:

Pod: The smallest unit; holds containers.

ReplicaSet: Ensures a set number of pod replicas.

Deployment: Manages ReplicaSets and handles updates/rollbacks.

3. How does Kubernetes perform a rolling update?
Answer:
When a deployment is updated:

Old pods are gradually replaced with new ones.

The process respects maxSurge and maxUnavailable settings to ensure availability.

4. What is a StatefulSet, and when should you use it?
Answer:
A StatefulSet is used for applications that require:

Stable, unique network identities (e.g., databases)

Persistent storage per pod
It ensures ordered deployment and scaling.

5. How does Kubernetes handle service discovery?
Answer:

Services get a DNS name via kube-dns or CoreDNS.

Environment variables and cluster DNS allow pods to discover other services.

6. What is a ConfigMap vs. a Secret in Kubernetes?
Answer:

ConfigMap: Stores non-sensitive config data in key-value format.

Secret: Stores sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens) in base64-encoded form.

7. How do liveness and readiness probes work?
Answer:

Liveness probe: Checks if a container is alive. If it fails, the container is restarted.

Readiness probe: Checks if a container is ready to serve traffic.

Example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 10
8. What are taints and tolerations in Kubernetes?
Answer:

Taints: Prevent pods from being scheduled on a node.

Tolerations: Allow pods to run on nodes with matching taints.

Used for node isolation (e.g., GPU workloads).

9. How does Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) work?
Answer:
HPA automatically scales the number of pods based on metrics (CPU/memory/custom).

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl autoscale deployment myapp --cpu-percent=70 --min=1 --max=10
10. What is a Helm chart?
Answer:
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. A Helm chart is a collection of templates and values used to define, install, and manage Kubernetes resources.

11. How do you debug a pod stuck in CrashLoopBackOff?
Answer:

Check logs: kubectl logs <pod>

Check describe: kubectl describe pod <pod>

Inspect image, probes, secrets, and config issues.

12. What is the difference between ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services?
Answer:

ClusterIP: Default, internal-only access.

NodePort: Exposes service on a static port on each node.

LoadBalancer: Uses cloud provider to expose service via external load balancer.

13. How do you mount a ConfigMap and a Secret to a pod?
Answer:

yaml
Copy
Edit
volumeMounts:
  - name: config-volume
    mountPath: /etc/config
volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: my-config
14. How does RBAC work in Kubernetes?
Answer:
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) controls user/group permissions.

Components:

Role/ClusterRole: Defines permissions.

RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding: Assigns roles to users.
